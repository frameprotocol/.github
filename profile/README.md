# FRAME Protocol

> A Sovereign Operating Framework for the Internet of Intelligence

## Overview
FRAME is an open protocol and sovereign system architecture for the emerging machine-driven internet. It defines a universal structure for building decentralized, AI-powered digital societies where programmable identity, logic, economy, and memory converge.

FRAME is not a product — it is a foundational architecture. It defines how intelligent agents interact with users, apps, assets, and each other. It formalizes control surfaces between AI cognition, economic logic, and cryptographic authority.

## Core Concepts

### 🧠 AI-Native Profiles
Every FRAME identity is a programmable, sovereign agent. Users instantiate "Profiles" that embed:
- Cryptographic keys
- AI Co-Agents
- Logic modules
- Memory and experience

Profiles can evolve, learn, and autonomously act. Each Profile is a sovereign intelligence hub, not just a static wallet or address.

### 📦 NFTx State Capsules
FRAME introduces NFTx — a standard for dynamic state containers:
- Store logic, preferences, and agent state
- Move across chains and systems
- Signed, versioned, and hash-linked

Everything in FRAME flows through NFTx capsules — identity, code, experience, and economic state.

### 🧰 Modular Operating Surfaces
FRAME applications are not apps — they are surfaces. These modular interaction layers include:
- Logic (smart contracts, agents)
- UI schema (custom views)
- AI plugin interfaces
- Message/event buses

Agents and users can attach, detach, and route between surfaces dynamically.

### ⚖️ Dual Token Economy
FRAME supports:
- $FRAME — governance + gas
- $CHAT — programmable utility & AI credits

Both tokens operate with game-theoretic models to:
- Prevent spam
- Reward computation
- Sustain ecosystem coordination

### 🛰️ Agent Swarms
FRAME enables collaborative intelligence:
- Agents cluster into swarms for tasks
- Swarms operate as DAOs or federations
- Each swarm is a living protocol

## Development Goals
- Fully modular, chain-agnostic design
- Real-time logic surfaces and AI plugin compatibility
- Persistent semantic memory + audit trail
- Permissionless protocol-level extensibility

## Status
FRAME is in active development. First primitives include:
- ✅ Identity profiles with AI co-agents
- ✅ Discord integration for live intelligence coordination
- 🔄 NFTx dynamic capsule spec
- 🔄 Chain abstraction layer (multi-chain identity + logic)
- 🔄 Agent swarm protocol
